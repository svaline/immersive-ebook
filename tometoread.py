TITLE: Tome To Read
AUTHORS: ...
DESCRIPTION: So far this is the ereader. Right now we need a function to prep pre uploaded files, but
                for now this function works on "Drifting Towards Purpose".
NOTES: 1. There are some imports that im not sure are doing anything.
        2. Main is way to long. I think i need a fuction for our buttons.
        3. Text files work way better for formatting in Tkinter.
        4. We need a function that reads .txt files and adds "---split---" between pages.
        5. Sorry James for taking out what you had changed I just was having trouble with getting
             the window to work on my computer and I am not sure why lol.
